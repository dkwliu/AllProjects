	     Seasteading
	  </h2>

	  <p>
	     Check out this new and exciting living style of the future. Seasteading is a beneficial, and some would say 
		 necessary, system of living that is gaining a lot of traction from entrepreneurs and longterm thinkers alike.
		 The basic idea of seasteading is to build a livable community on water. The benefits of such an arrangement varies
         and is dependent on who's asking, but the following is a list of general benefits:		 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	     -Great for people that need work visas, but have difficulty obtaining one. With seasteads, one can work
		 for another country while staying on the seastead.
		 -High economic potential. Seasteads can be used for tourism, working, and living.
		 -Great aesthetics. Of course the first few seasteads will be made with aesthetics in mind.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	     And to keep with the theme of this site, there are also environmental benefits.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	     -Less impact on land. Because the communities are built off-land, this decreases potentially environmentally hazardous
		 practices such as clear-cutting, habitat destruction, etc..
		 -Seasteads could promote more sustainable ways to generate energy. Since some seasteads would not be expected to be a
		 part of an energy grid, this promotes the use of sustainable energy, such as wind and sunlight.
		 -Seasteads are planned to be developed sustainably. Seastead organizations, such as Blueseed
		 and Seasteading Institute, are thinking of developing seasteads with sustainable materials and that are capable of sustaining
		 itself.
